2. Application: 
        We have 3 ideas for now (will go ahead with one for the next submission): 
              1. Workout Splits - A database to represent a workout routine.


              2. TV Shows - A database that holds information about media(creators, actors, producers, ratings, etc..).


              3. Food - A database that would store details of different foods(origin, ingredients, availability, etc..).
